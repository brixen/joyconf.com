#JoyConf Code of Conduct
We are coming together with an intent to care for ourselves and one another. We want to nurture an empathetic conference culture.

##Is this really necessary? 
Sometimes things go wrong. This code of conduct is an effort to prevent people being hurt, and to talk about what might happen if someone is hurt.
###Specific things
Here are some specific things that have occurred at conferences. We do not expect them to occur at JoyConf (of course!). We also want to take positive action to prevent them. Just to be sure.

- Someone talked about vim as though non-vim people are less-than, and onlookers felt shitty.
- A woman was followed back to the hotel by drunk men she doesn't know, loudly joking about how hot she is.
- A black man attending a conference overheard white folks "acting black"
- A drunk boss groped a female employee, with other people looking on.

##The primary rule is consent. 
No one at JoyConf, or at any events associated with JoyConf, may speak to, touch, stare at, follow, or otherwise engage someone without their consent. Making jokes within earshot of someone who is upset by them is a violation of consent. Acting as though someone's gender is other than what they say it is is also a violation of consent. Doing things that people feel shitty about is often a violation of consent. Doing them more than once is even more likely a violation of consent.

##The other primary rule is no shaming.

Shaming is hard to define. So we don't define it, we listen to each other. We work to learn how our behavior affects others. Here are some areas you may get the opportunity to learn about.

- No racism
- No geekier-than-thou
- No sexism
- No ableism
- No homophobia
- No fatphobia or body shaming
- No religious or non-religious shaming 

##When someone's hurting
When someone's hurting, there is a problem. There is no such thing as "overreacting". There is hurting, and there is empathy.

##Empathy is our preference
When something's happened and someone is hurting, our first choice is to work through it. If an attendee's actions result in someone feeling unsafe, the staff will take the situation seriously. 

##But empathy isn't the only option
Sometimes, one or both parties are either uninterested or unable to work through the problem. Sometimes, to do so might take more time that we have. To not understand why something is hurtful is okay, as long as you approach it with care and curiosity. Repeating hurtful behavior is not allowed, and that will result in removal from the conference.

If, in the view of the staff, someone is not able to follow the conference rules, that person may be ejected from the conference without refund or compensation

##What to do if you experience something you aren't okay with
- You have the option of trying to speak with the person who is giving you trouble. 
- If you want to, you may ask for staff support for this conversation.
- If you don't want to, or if they refuse to speak to you, you can get an organizer to help you. Your pre-conference email will contain complete contact information for staff. Female contact: Sara Blackthorne. Male contact: Jason Felice. Nonbinary/trans contact: Alex Harms


##Contributing to a culture of empathy
If someone "calls you out", hear the feedback. Listen for their experience, the feelings coming up. Consider how those emotions feel to you; notice what you have in common. Accept that something you did brought those feeling up for that person. Doesn't mean you decide you are bad, or you were "wrong" -- it means that you notice what happened, and accept it. Receive the feedback, and whatever clarifications they're _happy_ to provide, and then in private, mull them over. Ask friends questions, and decide for yourself what resonates with you and what doesn't, and what actions you want to take in response.

If you see something that seems off or scary, ask how folks are doing, or grab a staff member for help. We will not blow you off. We will be grateful.

##Addendum for staff & volunteers
As staff or volunteer, you have a lot of jobs. Here are three:
- It is your job to be available to solve problems that come up relating to people, like if someone's not able to follow the code of conduct. 
- It's also your job to solve accessibility issues, like if there's a cord that could trip someone using a cane, or if aisles aren't big enough for a wheelchair, or any other access issue.
- It's your job to make sure transgender folk have access to bathrooms.
- It's your job to watch for people feeling left out, and include them.
